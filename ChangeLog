ChangeLog of HGTector

== Version 0.2.0 (major upgrade) (10/25/2015) ==

Note:
- Major modification of the entire pipeline.

Structural change:
- Renamed blaster and summarizer as searcher and reporter, respectively.
- Removed filterer, taxonomer and validator
- Renamed input / output files and directories.
- Re-wrote searcher.
- Re-wrote the main program.
- Re-wrote the GUI.

New features:
- New script databaser.py to create a customized, taxonomically balanced BLAST database, which
significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of HGT discovery, comparing to the
original nr.
- Added native support for non-BLAST search tools, including RAPSearch2 and DIAMOND.
- Allowed one protein to correspond to multiple TaxIDs. This further balances the taxonomic
distribution of reference proteins.

Bug fixes:
- Many bug fixes.


== Same version number (9/1/2015) ==

New features:
- Re-wrote the GUI.

Bug fixes:
- Several bug fixes.


== Version 0.1.9 (6/1/2015) ==

New features:
- Accepting pre-computed BLAST results (by BLAST, Blat, Usearch, etc).
- Sending multiple query sequences per search, thus accelerating the batch BLAST task.
- Looking up taxonomy from a GI-to-TaxID dictionary, thus accelerating the process.
- Plotting reference gene set along with prediction results.
- Percentage coverage cutoff (for BLAST search).

Bug fixes:
- Updated the BLAST server URL.
- Improved efficiency of batch BLAST and result processing.
- Allowed taxonomy of input genomes defined in config.txt. 
- Multiple bug fixes in Perl code and in GUI.
