ChangeLog of HGTector

== Version 0.1.9 (6/1/2015) ==

New features:
- Accepting pre-computed BLAST results (by BLAST, Blat, Usearch, etc).
- Sending multiple query sequences per search, thus accelerating the batch BLAST task.
- Looking up taxonomy from a GI-to-TaxID dictionary, thus accelerating the process.
- Plotting reference gene set along with prediction results.
- Percentage coverage cutoff (for BLAST search).

Bug fixes:
- Updated the BLAST server URL.
- Improved efficiency of batch BLAST and result processing.
- Allowed taxonomy of input genomes defined in config.txt.
