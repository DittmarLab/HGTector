+----------------------+

This example is to demonstrate the basic usage and predicting power of HGTector.

The input dataset is 100 protein-coding genes from the genome of Galdieria sulphuraria (NCBI ID: 405), a unicellular red alga found in hot sulphur springs. The genome of G. sulphuraria and its HGT pattern was explored in this paper:

Sch√∂nknecht, G. et al. Gene transfer from bacteria and archaea facilitated evolution of an extremophilic eukaryote. Science 339, 1207-10 (2013)

You can use HGTector to analyze this dataset with basic settings, by executing the following command in the program folder:

  perl HGTector.pl example

If your system environment meets all requirements (see "Checklist" of "GUI.html" for details), you can also try advanced settings, by replacing "config.txt" with "advanced_config.txt" and then executing the above command.

The program will guide you through the whole process. Typically, it will take approximately 1-2 hours to BLAST all 100 genes and retrieve the taxonomic information of all hits, then it will take dozens of seconds to complete the rest of the analysis.

After the analysis is finished, you will find a "result" folder, in which the predicted HGT-derived genes are listed in "HGT/gsul.txt" and are summarized in "report.html". In our test, 9 genes were predicted to be HGT-derived, including two ArsB genes (EME29520 and EME26816), as described in Figure 3 of the above paper.

We have tested this process, and packaged the result in the compressed file "example_output.zip". You can refer to the content of this file to see whether your analysis is correct and your result is reasonable. Note: the result is subject to change by time, since GenBank is being updated every minute!
