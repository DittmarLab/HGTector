HGTector2
=========

**HGTector2** is a completely re-engineered software tool, featuring a fully-automated analytical pipeline with smart determination of parameters which requires minimum human involvement, a re-designed command-line interface which facilitates standardized scientific computing, and a high-quality Python 3 codebase.

**HGTector** is a computational pipeline for genome-wide detection of putative horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events based on sequence homology search hit distribution statistics.
