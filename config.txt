# This is a template of the configuration file (config.txt). It contains all parameters
# of the program, with their default values and descriptions. You can create your own
# configuration file based on this template, or from the user graphic interface (GUI.html).
# The configuration file should be placed in the working directory. It may include only
# parameters whose values you wish to modify (non-default).

# Unless otherwise stated, 0 means off, 1 means on, blank means default.
# Characters after a number sign (#) are comments and will not be parsed.

## Batch BLAST (blaster.pl) ##

  # BLAST mode
    # 0 (default): send requests to a BLAST server to query a remote database.

  blastMode=0

  # pre-computed BLAST results (local BLAST only)
    # Specify a folder that contains BLAST results. One file per protein set.
    # The BLAST results must be in standard tabular format (-outfmt 6)
    # Results generated by alternative programs, such as Blat and USEARCH, are valid too,
      # as long as the format is compatible.

  ## BLAST parameters ##

    # BLAST database (if it is a local database, you may also include its path)
    dbBlast=nr

    # Maximum E-value cutoff (also used in analyzer.pl)
    evalue=1e-5

    # Minimum percent identity cutoff (also used in analyzer.pl)
    identity=

    # Minimum percent coverage cutoff (also used in analyzer.pl)
      # coverage = match region (bp) / query sequence (bp)
    coverage=

    # Number of hits to return
    nHits=500

    # Maximum number of valid hits to preserve (default: no limit) (also used in analyzer.pl)
    maxHits=

    # Entrez filters (remote BLAST only)

      # Exclude uncultured and environmental samples
      exUncultured=1

      # Ignore organisms under the following taxids
      ignoreTaxids=

      # User-specified Entrez query text (will override settings above)
      eqText=


## Filterring BLAST hits (blaster.pl and filterer.pl) ##

  # These settings affect both blaster.pl and filterer.pl.
  # In the former case, the filtered-out hits will not be preserved in BLAST reports.
    # One may choose this to save disk space.
  # In the later case, the filtered-out hits will be marked with an 'x' in BLAST reports.
    # One may choose this to perform multiple analyses under different parameter sets without redoing BLAST.

  # Ignore taxon names that do not start with a capital letter
  taxonUCASE=1

  # Ignore taxon names containing the following words
  ignoreTaxa=unknown,uncultured,unidentified,unclassified,environmental,plasmid,vector,synthetic,phage
    # Some taxa are too frequently sequenced in the database. They may be masked, too. For example:
    # ignoreTaxa=Escherichia coli,Yersinia pestis,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Salmonella enterica,Vibrio cholerae

  # Merge hits with same taxon names and bit scores
  mergeDuplicates=1

  # Ignore potential paralogs (hits from same organisms but with lower bit scores)
  ignoreParalogs=1

  # Ignore repeated sequence domains (hits) within the same protein
  ignoreSeqRepeats=1

  # Ignore more than one subspecies from the same species
    # This is recommended for cases involving bacteria, as there may be hundreds of strains of a
    # same species in the database.
  ignoreSubspecies=0


## Phylogenetic pipeline (treer.pl) ##

  # These are additional functionalities. They will not affect the prediction result of HGTector, unless one
    # choose to analyze phylogenetic distance instead of BLAST bit score.
  # The purpose of this pipeline is to facilitate validation and further analyses after running HGTector.

  # Trim unreliable regions from sequence alignment (options: gblocks)
  trimSeq=

  # Realign sequences (options: clustalw, mafft, muscle, clustalo)

  buildTree=

    # Amino acid substitution model (options: prottest|criteria, or a specified model)
      # Valid only when PhyML or RAxML is selected. Examples:
      # aaModel=prottest|BIC
      # aaModel=LG+I+G+F
    aaModel=

    # Number of bootstrap replicates (blank means no bootstrapping)
      # for PhyML this is the "-b" parameter. Refer to the PhyML manual for details.
      # for FastTree it will perform SH-test, regardless of this parameter.

  ## Grouping scenario ##

    # Option 1: define the 'self' rank
      # All organisms within the same rank as the input genomes are considered as 'self'.
      # Meanwhile, all organisms (except for 'self' organisms) within the same one-level-up
      # rank are considered as 'close'. All other organisms are defined as 'distal'.
    selfRank=0

      # Here is an example: assume the input is some Escherichia genomes, then:
      # selfRank=genus        # genus level (Escherichia)
      # selfRank=family       # family level (Enterobacteriaceae)
      # selfRank=0            # the lowest rank that includes all input genomes (Escherichia)
      # selfRank=1            # the second lowest rank (Enterobacteriaceae)
    
    # Option 2: manually specify TaxID(s) for each group
      # TaxIDs can be looked-up in NCBI taxonomy database. They don't have to be limited to
      # taxonomic ranks defined by 'ranks'.
      # If there are multiple TaxIDs, separate them with commas.
      # Will override option 1.
    selfGroup=
    closeGroup=

  ## Sampling method ##

    # Normalize bit scores as (subject / query)
    normalize=1

    # Use weight (sum of bit scores) instead of number of hits
    useWeight=1

    # Use phylogenetic distance instead of BLAST bit scores
    useDistance=0

    # Global or individual fingerprint (BLAST hit distribution pattern)
      # 0: each protein set has its own pattern
      # 1: one pattern for all protein sets

  ## Fingerprints visualization ##

  ## (IMPORTANT) Cutoffs determination ##

    # Strategy of determining cutoffs
      # 0: user-specified global cutoff
      # 1: user-specified individual cutoffs
      # 2: wait for user to type individual cutoffs
      # 3: draw histogram and isolate the first peak
      # 4: perform kernel density estimation and isolate the first peak
      # 5: (requires R) perform hierarchical clustering and isolate the first cluster
    howCO=4

    # User-specified global cutoff (defaults to 0.25, or the first quartile)
      # It applies to all three groups if howCO = 0.
      # It also applies to individual groups if other chosen approaches fail to determine cutoffs for
      # these particular groups.
    globalCO=0.25

    # User-specified cutoffs for individual groups
      # It is an absolute value, rather than a quantile.
      # For example, "1.35" means that values <= 1.35 are atypical.

    selfCO=
